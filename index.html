      <h3>The song lyrics</h3>
      <p><font color="yellow">I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Each pokemon to understand
The power that's inside

[Chorus]
Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all! It's you and me
I know it's my destiny,
Pokemon! Oh you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon! A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through,

You teach me and I'll teach you,
Pokemon! Gotta catch'em all

[Chorus]

Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face.
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place.
Come with me,
The time is right,
There's no better team.
Arm in arm we'll win the fight!
It's always been our dream!

[Chorus]</font></p>
